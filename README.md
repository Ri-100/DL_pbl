# Wildfire Detection System üî•üå≤  

## Overview  
The Wildfire Detection System is a real-time deep learning solution designed to detect wildfires and smoke from images and video datasets. Using advanced computer vision models like CNN, ResNet50, and YOLOv8/YOLOv9, the system aims to provide accurate and timely alerts to prevent and mitigate wildfire disasters.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Detection:** Identifies wildfires and smoke in images and videos with high precision.  
- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes state-of-the-art models like YOLOv9 for fast and accurate object detection.  
- **Scalable and Flexible:** Supports large-scale datasets and real-time deployment.  
- **Data Augmentation:** Improves model generalization using techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping.  



## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas  
- **Models:** CNN, ResNet50, YOLOv8/YOLOv9  
- **Tools:** Google Colab, Roboflow  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit  

## How It Works  
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**  
   - Datasets sourced from Kaggle and Roboflow with over 65,535 images and videos.  
   - Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.  

2. **Model Training:**  
   - Trained CNN, ResNet50, and YOLOv9 for wildfire and smoke detection.  
   - Used transfer learning to enhance performance and reduce training time.  

3. **Evaluation and Optimization:**  
   - Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1 score.  
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal results.  

4. **Deployment:**  
   - Deployed the detection system using Streamlit for real-time user interaction.  

## Installation and Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Ri-100/DL_pbl.git  
   cd DL_pbl
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
3. Set up the environment:

Use Google Colab or a local machine with a GPU for training the models.

4. Run the application:
